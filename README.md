##### About the project

Users can use this app to create and play their very own, original music. The user selects from a flexible set of instruments (currently, this includes a large variety of drum samples), then uses an intutive point-and-click interface to create an original step-sequence that defines a musical loop.

A user can save original music files as private projects. Or a the user can change a project's privacy setting to 'public' and share it with other Beat Locker users.

The app's 'Community' page presents a searchable listing of public projects shared by users. These are available to browse and play. If desired, a browsing user can fork another user's public project to create a copy that can then be modified, expanded upon, and, perhaps, shared again.

##### How the app was made

Beat Locker is a project built with NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Vue/Vuex. The app leverages the power of the Web Audio API and the ToneJS framework.

This app is a collaborative project built by [Randy King](https://github.com/brandallk), [Russ Carr](https://github.com/RussCarr), and [Joe Davis](https://github.com/joe-r-davis). We (Joe, Russ, and Randy) are full-stack web developer students at the Boise CodeWorks bootcamp. Beat Locker is our capstone project for this course.

##### State of the project

Beat Locker remains a work-in-progress at present. It currently requires additional work to fix bugs and to add and finish additional features. We are hard at work finishing up these remaining items.
